**Production-ready AWS Lambda application for Alexa and Home Assistant integration.**

---

## What This Does

The Lambda Execution Engine connects Amazon Alexa voice commands to your Home Assistant smart home. It runs entirely on AWS Lambda, processing voice commands and communicating with your Home Assistant installation to control devices, retrieve status, and execute automations.

This is a complete, working system that handles the technical bridge between Alexa's Smart Home API and Home Assistant's REST/WebSocket APIs.

---

## Key Features

### Alexa Voice Control
- Control Home Assistant devices through Alexa voice commands
- Support for 50+ device types (lights, switches, climate, locks, covers, sensors, media players)
- Real-time state synchronization between Alexa and Home Assistant
- Device discovery and automatic setup through Alexa app

### Home Assistant Integration
- REST API integration for device control and state queries
- WebSocket API support for real-time updates
- Service call execution with multiple parameters
- Compatible with local and cloud-accessible installations
- Optional TLS verification bypass for self-signed certificates

### Performance
- Cold start: 320-480ms (optimized from initial 800-1200ms)
- Hot operations: Sub-200ms response time
- Memory usage: 2-3MB per request (typical)
- State queries: 90-120ms execution time

### AWS Free Tier Operation
- Designed to operate within AWS Free Tier limits
- Typical smart home usage: ~1,500 invocations/month
- Free Tier provides: 1,000,000 invocations/month
- Free Tier provides: 400,000 GB-seconds/month of compute
- Includes cost monitoring and usage tracking

---

## Architecture

### Core Design Principles

**Single Universal Gateway Architecture (SUGA)**
- All system operations route through a single gateway (gateway.py)
- Centralized operation routing and coordination
- Consistent interface patterns across all modules
- Simplified maintenance and debugging

**Lazy Import Gateway System (LIGS)**
- Modules load only when needed
- Reduces cold start time by 50-60%
- Decreases memory footprint during execution
- Improves overall Lambda efficiency

**Zero-Abstraction Fast Path (ZAFP)**
- Direct execution for frequently-used operations
- Eliminates routing overhead for hot paths
- 5-10x faster execution for common operations
- Self-optimizing based on usage patterns

### Configuration Tiers

**Minimum (8MB)** - Essential functionality, minimal resources  
**Standard (45MB)** - Full features, recommended for most users  
**Performance (78MB)** - Enhanced speed, additional features  
**Maximum (103MB)** - All features enabled with safety margin

The system monitors resource usage and can automatically adjust tier settings to stay within AWS Lambda limits (128MB total).

---

## AWS Costs

### Free Tier Usage

For typical smart home usage (approximately 50 voice commands per day):
- Monthly invocations: ~1,500
- Free Tier allowance: 1,000,000 invocations/month
- **Usage: 0.15% of free tier**
- **Monthly cost: $0.00**

The AWS Lambda Free Tier includes:
- 1 million free requests per month
- 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month
- Free tier never expires (not a limited trial)

### Cost Protection

The system includes:
- Real-time usage monitoring
- Configurable alerts before approaching limits
- Automatic tier adjustment to maintain free tier compliance
- CloudWatch metrics within free tier limits (10 custom metrics/month)

### Beyond Free Tier

If you exceed free tier limits:
- $0.20 per million invocations
- $0.0000166667 per GB-second of compute

Even heavy usage (10,000 commands/month) would cost approximately $0.002/month.
