interface_cache.py - Cache Interface Router (SUGA-ISP Architecture)
Version: 2025.10.16.03
Description: Firewall router for Cache interface

This file acts as the interface router (firewall) between the SUGA-ISP
and internal implementation files. Only this file may be accessed by
gateway.py. Internal files are isolated.

CHANGELOG:
- 2025.10.16.03: Bug fixes - added cleanup_expired routing, standardized operation names,
                 improved error messages, added valid operations constant
- 2025.10.15.01: Initial SUGA-ISP router implementation
