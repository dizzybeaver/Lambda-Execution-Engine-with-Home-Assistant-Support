interface_initialization.py - Initialization Interface Router (SUGA-ISP Architecture)
Version: 2025.10.16.01
Description: Firewall router for Initialization interface - BUGS FIXED

This file acts as the interface router (firewall) between the SUGA-ISP
and internal implementation files. Only this file may be accessed by
gateway.py. Internal files are isolated.

FIXES APPLIED:
- Added missing 'get_config' operation route
- Added missing 'is_initialized' operation route
- Added missing 'reset' operation route
- Added 3 missing implementation function imports
- Improved error handling with complete operation list
